## Professional Career

### Current Employment at [Accelo](https://www.accelo.com/)

Employed as a full stack developer.

Writing code and unit tests for short and long term projects. Frequently with a Test Driven Development approach.

Sam is able to work quickly. Here is a screenshot of the most recent week long sprint:
![Sprint Screenshot](images/end_of_week_screenshot_small.png)
(Week ending 2017-07-07. All but two tasks on screen were started that week)

Working with the Elastic stack to provide prompt responses to user actions.

Able to work comfortably in a continuous integration style company. (Code going into production multiple times a day)

Work also involves monitoring the behaviour of production cloud infrastructure. 

Although less often, work at Accelo has also involved the statistical analysis of different versions of code while seeking to improve performance. 

### Previous Employment at [IMB Bank](http://www.imb.com.au/)

Employed as an Analyst. Also worked as a developer.

Worked on the core legacy system.

Created interoperability between the core system and newly installed [teller cash recyclers](https://arca.com/solutions/cash-recycling).

Created web front ends for existing databases.

Wrote a parser to convert human readable database schemas (for the core noSQL database).
This allowed the creation of machine readable schemas and web-based documentation.

Promoted the use of version control (now in place) and automated unit testing.

Met up with a board member of the bank to discuss the modernisation of the development environment several times. Even after resigning.

### Contract work

In addition to ongoing employment, Sam also does contract work. (Australian Business Number: 42530866880)

Sam has worked for [Tradimo](https://learn.tradimo.com/about) as a programming coach. This work involved meeting with traders to discuss how automation through programming can assist with trading. Programs to assist with trading were created and distributed on the site. 

Working for the University of Wollongong and related organisations, Sam created programs to assist in the collection and processing of data for academics. His work has been acknowledged in three papers, one of which he is co-author.

The program written for the above mentioned paper involved the tracking of maggots observed through thermal and visible-light cameras. 

Sam wrote a data conversion program for accountancy firm [PKF Lawler](https://www.pkf.com.au/) to assist with government compliance.

After complaints about sound levels at an auditorium, Sam analysed and modelled audio energy levels and presented a report to board members.

## Hobbies

### Rock Climbing

Sam takes advantage of having an [indoor climbing gym](http://hangdog.com.au/) within walking distance of work.

Climbing more complex routes takes skill and planning, not just physical strength.

There is great satisfaction to be had after achieving a goal through continued persistence.

### Audio Engineering

Part hobby, part volunteering, part professional work. Sam has been recording and mixing audio for more than 14 years.

Skills that have been acquired in this field have found use in other areas of Sam's life. The audio signal chain is a helpful mental model when considering time-series data analysis. The principals of component extraction from a signal are often similar across disciplines.

Sam has worked on many side projects over the years inspired by issues faced in the field of audio mixing. 

## Side Projects

### Kaggle Competitions 

### Cloud based Audio mastering 

### Machine Learning research

Predicting future state changes of nodes (with a high degree of centrality) by modelling the influence of behavioural anomalies in time series graph data.

State changes to nodes with a high eigencentrality


In some systems, there is value in maintaining the current state of an entity. 

In such systems, it is then also valuable to keep the system in a state that reduces the probability of the state change of the entity

Events and communication in such a system can be modelled as a time series of directed edges in a graph. 

Behaviour can be understood as sequences of events (with a meta model describing the relationship of these events)

If the system is optimised for maintaining the state of these important entities, then behaviour that disrupts such a steady state would be considered anomalous.

Assuming all of the above, understanding when the system is currently (or is about to be) is a state that increases the probability of a change to the entity, allows for intervention to return the system back to a more stable state.
